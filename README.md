### Hello there. My name is Sergei. I recently graduated from an immersive coding bootcamp called Code Chrysalis where I went through rigorous training to become a full-stack developer and now looking for my first full-time position.
Been living in Japan for 2 years. My hobbies and interests beside programming are learning languages, making music, writing poetry, acquiring skills I don't yet posses and learning things I don't yet know etc. I enjoy learning new technologies and recently I've been having fun with IoT.
